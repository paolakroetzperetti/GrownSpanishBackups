Draw Your Game is a user-friendly application allowing anyone and everyone to create their own video game in a few quick steps: ▶ Draw your game's world on a piece of paper, using four different colors (black, blue, green and red). ▶ Use the 'Draw Your Game' app to take a picture of your drawing. ▶ Wait 10 seconds, while Draw Your Game transforms the drawing into a game. ▶ Play your game, with a character that you can control. ▶ Share your creation with other Draw Your Game users. Four different colors to create the world of your choosing: ▶ Black for stationary floors/ground; ▶ Blue for movable objects that the character can push around; ▶ Green for elements that the character will bounce off of; ▶ Red for objects that will destroy the character or the blue objects. Draw Your Game allows you to create an infinite number of worlds, either on the same sheet of paper or by adding new sheets, one after the other, to create a real story line. There are two available modes: ▶ “Create” mode, to create your own worlds; ▶ “Play” mode, to play in the worlds created by the community, either in “campaign” mode (worlds selected by our team), or in “catalogue” mode, where you can use search criteria to choose a world yourself. There are several ways to play the different worlds, at the creator's choice: ▶ “Escape”: the character must find a way off the paper to escape and win the game; ▶ “Destruction”: the character must push blue objects into red ones to destroy them. Our teams approve each new world before releasing it to the community, and a rating system is used to rank the top worlds against one another. [] ▶ Use fairly wide felt-tip pens. ▶ Choose vivid colors. ▶ Take pictures under good lighting.","['English']","['English']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/header.jpg?t=1502354684","","http://www.draw-your-game.com/","contact@zerokcm.fr",True,False,False,0,"",0,18,50,"",43,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Zero One","Zero One","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Partial Controller Support","Casual","Casual,Platformer,Hand-drawn","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_1678380950ebac84202055083b6203c8e8e0163e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_2c500bf228b7eb77b417e3a33d923ad2a808f852.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_bff6bdf44b1b291473520cc136afbca3f4d50e51.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_d94d37ed784c6f52cb31b795e2c364ed97f45851.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_9b456ef2f86761bc6b63544d272516638efbc09a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_105e22f97a7148e33bd0d6b0791547a3bb58cbed.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_caf80ca9da235d21c2f9e9c606aec64a0661dfd7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_99272a04bf3261225ea88048764790614e8abd0f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256689941/movie_max.mp4?t=1501794251"

If so you are not alone. Hugo Banchee is a testosterone-fueled hulk of a man with serious anger management issues and he is in a hurry to get to the gym. Trouble is, it happens to be Pension Day. Hugo knows his route will be blocked by dithering, doddering old people who flock to the Post Office each Tuesday to pick up their pension payments. Even Hugo's therapist cannot seem to calm him down this time! Can Hugo reach his destination without upsetting too many old people? Or will he bump into so many that his overwrought heart will implode, leaving him dying in the street? You must preserve some semblance of Hugo's respect for the elderly long enough for him to reach the sanctuary of his beloved gym in Julian Henley's latest hilarious social commentary on modern life! Gameplay The game mechanics are deceptively simple (you will master them immediately but die many times). As Hugo walks up the road you must control his direction using the arrow keys thereby preventing collisions with other characters and vehicles. Colliding with the elderly characters will enrage Hugo, putting stress on his heart and reducing his health. Hugo's health is also dented by colliding with moving vehicles. Helping an old man across the road is a calming experience and will boost Hugo's health, as will catching tranquilizing capsules which occasionally fall in Hugo's path. Keep Hugo alive long enough and you will eventually reach the destination and victory!","['English']","['English']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/header.jpg?t=1651033778","","","jhenley123@outlook.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,0,1,"",0,0,"There is a small amount of mildly offensive language.",0,0,0,0,"Julian Henley","Julian Henley","Single-player","Action,Casual","Action,Casual,Arcade,Pixel Graphics,2D,Cartoony,Funny,Linear,Singleplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_3554f50d7f2b332e4dd5544aaea9721424eb3c27.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_77f06fc8e4502728f42cd92855a089303f282b01.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_449d5dc65de5556cf6a4751d88a45cc1fe2a8db6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_b61f9f1d33f7a02025dd47ccae811f5a581c47b2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_9690b616cae80d95cd31c91d01e9e50819e73230.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_17e8964a5be9ce7a3c3cb031ad5882d565d63813.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_50141b7333cba15cdc983aa2806b9590db466131.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_f393400e7addb1cfdac84fde14e3d6cd93d41f79.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256759250/movie_max.mp4?t=1566330531"
